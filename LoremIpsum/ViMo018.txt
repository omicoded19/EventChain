The Holy Golden Rain


I was sent to the World of Dwarves after a terrific accident.. Since I was much taller than them, I easily took over and became 
their king. I spent a year ruling them claiming I was the most powerful human on earth....and so they treated me like a god
as i could walk their entire country in 1 single step

One night, a huge fire boke out.. everyone was terrified they screamed and cried for help "Save us great king!! , Use your human
magic" I did not have any water so I panicked. I stood on a tower and urinated on the flames to put them out. The fire went away but
the entire city smelled like a giant bathroom. I tried and shouted " Ladies and Gentleman, this is the HOLY GOLDEN RAIN!"

The dwarves didn't bow instead they realized I was just a gross guy with a gian bladder. They immediately kicked me off the throne
spent 2 years making a cage for me and put me inside a zoo charging tourists to see "Big Smelly Giant"


it is literally 3 am and this is only creative shit that i could think pls ignore
